# CMake Error Fix Summary

## Problem
```
CMake Error: Error required internal CMake variable not set, cmake may not be built correctly.
Missing variable is:
CMAKE_C_ARCHIVE_FINISH
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. The main project declared only `CXX` language support
2. LuaSec subdirectory requires C language support for building its C libraries
3. CMake couldn't properly initialize C toolchain variables when they were needed by the subdirectory

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added C Language Support
**File:** `/Users/lucasabbas/kenai/CMakeLists.txt`

**Before:**
```cmake
project( kenai
    LANGUAGES
        CXX
    VERSION
        0.1.0
)
```

**After:**
```cmake
project( kenai
    LANGUAGES
        C
        CXX
    VERSION
        0.1.0
)
```

### 2. Fixed LuaSec Linking
**Added proper linking to LuaSec targets:**

```cmake
# For LuaJIT builds
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
    PRIVATE
        luasocket::static
        luasec::ssl  # Added this
)

# For Lua 5.1.5 builds  
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
    PRIVATE
        luasocket::static
        luasec::ssl  # Added this
)
```

### 3. Added Default Build Type
**Prevent similar configuration issues:**

```cmake
# Set default build type if not specified
if(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
    set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release" CACHE STRING "Choose the type of build" FORCE)
    set_property(CACHE CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE PROPERTY STRINGS "Debug" "Release" "MinSizeRel" "RelWithDebInfo")
endif()
```

## Verification
✅ CMake configuration now completes successfully
✅ Build process starts without C toolchain errors  
✅ LuaSec static library builds correctly as subdirectory
✅ Proper linking between main project and C libraries

## Key Takeaway
When using CMake subdirectories that require different language support than the main project, ensure all required languages are declared in the main project's `project()` command. This is especially important when:

- Main project is C++ only but uses C library subdirectories
- Subdirectories build static/shared libraries in C
- Cross-language linking is involved

The fix ensures CMake properly initializes all necessary toolchain variables for both C and C++ compilation and linking.
